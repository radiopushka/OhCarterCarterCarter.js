agile{}nah man, up your game you are not agile[]
i love anime{}i want to cuddle with a cute anime shyojyo at the scrum meeting[]
hello{}こにちわ！[]
hey bot?{}yeah? what do you want, i am busy with the effort logger.[]
 test {}heck yeah there will be a test you bet ya, thought this class was easy?[]
effort logger{}psss... thats due Friday(金)[]
japanese?{}what do you think? Learning Japanese is essential to understanding the Kanban System which is essential to becoming a scrum samurai.そういえば、 僕は良い日本語をできます。でも、 あなたは 日本語を言ますね？[]
due?{}today! god, kids these days are so lazy, I have over 45 years of experience in software engineering practice, management, education, and research.[]
honkai star rail{}is that the game kids these days play?[]

i am so tired today{}stop being an ass[]
what is todays date{}<date>[]
i need help carter{}well, as i always say: <quote>[]
scrum meeting now{}yeah, join[]
two factor authentication{}more like two fucktor authentication smh[]
two factor authentication{}more like two fucktor authentication smh[]
when is phase due{}it is probably due this Friday[]
i hate taking tests{}I personally love them[]
gotta respect the dedication{}yeah, ngl i respect agile methods[]
this man is playing honkai start rail{}that game helps me cope with void in my sole that opened after my wife left me[]
i don’t think it was carter{}It has been me all along[]
does the bot on this server learn{}yes, it learns every time you reply to somebody's message. It is an experimental chat bot AI.[]
i want to make it so that it learns from conversations and then responds i am curious to see what will happen like a chat bot ai{}like machine learning? neat[]
like machine learning neat{}yeah basically. i got it to save messages so far, now i have to teach it to delete things that do not make sense. but in order for it to know someone has to reply to it and say something like "wtf" or "doesn't make sense"[]
lmao just repeats you when it sees the exact same message{}basically, except it only saves it if the message is a reply to a different person[]
it needs to learn from us though{}just force everyone to reply to the messages they respond to[]
just force everyone to reply to the messages they respond to{}idk about that. would be better though if people could tell it what is wrong and what does not make sense and reply to iy[]
carter knows{}carter knows everything, he sees everything. He is a god that was created from the depths of the web. arising from the fabric that connects the world wide web itself.[]def something carter would say{}Carter is the main most agile man on the planet, and this is just one of his most agile phrases. How is the phase going?[]
bullshiting the phases help a lot{}that is true, that is what i do. The TAs don't care so they just give you full marks as long as it looks complete and correct. they won't read the whole thing.[]
lowkey might as well be grader for this class and get free money lmao{}I think one needs to get approved by carter for that. I do not think everyone who applies gets it. I know I got offered the position by the teacher.[]
carter offered u a position{}Lol of course not. Another teacher did, it is for circuits 1. I TA for circuits1.[]
dont worry your bot will be useful fs either way dude{}thank you man. I just need people to talk to each other that way the bot learns and i can work on errors when they come up. That is the agile development method for this discord bot.[]
clearly not dead enough as you still needed to respond{}too dead for lynn robert carter 2.0[]
also if either string is under 10 chars then the bot will ignore it as of right now i am thinking about that part{}Nah I think that makes sense.[]
nah i think that makes sense{}yeah because it can become annoying when the bot responds to everything.  I wonder if there is any library in node js that can work with words and word contexts. like if one word is similar to another word.[]
im not doing much of studying for this class tbh man{}then you are just more lucky than me that is all i can say. I used the cheatsheet on the first test yet I still got under 70%. I tried to make my own cheat sheet which resulted in me getting under 50%[]
but if i can help in some way let me know{}can we study together for the next exam or something?[]
the thing is i dont even study for it man i just use the cheat sheet{}well, you are good at understanding all the terminology and you are more careful than me. I do not know what cadence is(one of the things carter asked me today)[]
the cheat sheets carry evan you just gotta use them right{}alright I will give them one more shot but If I won't get a full marks I basically have to withdraw or else I will get a failiing grade. this class is much worse than Indella's[]
thats the only way i unfortunately{}It is fine man. I mean yeah, it is just basically luck at this point so yeah. I will study the cheat sheet for exam 3. thank you for reaching out though.[]
